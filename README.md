## Warning

**Do NOT deploy the Web frontend on the public internet.** It is designed for personal use on a trusted LAN only. Exposing it publicly may lead to attacks, traffic abuse, and data leaks (cookies, WebDAV config, personal data). All legal and security risks are your own.

## Quick Start

### Native App

```bash
flutter build apk        # Android
flutter build windows    # Windows
flutter build linux      # Linux
flutter build macos      # macOS
```

### Web PWA

Vue 3 PWA powered by a Node.js server + Rust image proxy sidecar. Primarily for iOS users who cannot sideload native apps — host on a local server and access via Safari.

> **Experimental:** The Web PWA is still under active development. Expect bugs and incomplete features — many native-app capabilities are not yet fully ported. Use it for personal testing only.

**Docker (Recommended)**

```bash
cd web
docker compose up -d --build
# http://localhost:60098
```

**Manual**

Requires Node.js 20+ and Rust.

```bash
cd web/client && npm ci && npm run build   # build frontend
cd ../server && npm install --omit=dev      # install deps
VENERA_STATIC_DIR=../client/dist node server.js
# http://localhost:8080
```

**Development**

```bash
# Terminal 1: server (port 3000)
cd web/server
VENERA_STATIC_DIR=../client/dist node server.js

# Terminal 2: Vite hot-reload (port 5173)
cd web/client
npm ci && npm run dev
```

## Build from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (for native app)
3. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for server sidecar)
4. Node.js 20+ (for Web frontend & server runtime)

## Migration

If migrating from [venera-app/venera](https://github.com/venera-app/venera), use a separate WebDAV sync directory. Back up your old data before migrating.
